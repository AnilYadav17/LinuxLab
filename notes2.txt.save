	1. Kernel
The kernel is the core part of an operating system.
It controls everything at the hardware level.

Key Responsibilities
Memory management (allocating RAM to processes)
Process management (creating, scheduling, terminating processes)
Device management (keyboard, mouse, disk, network, etc.)
File system management
Security & permissions

Important point:
The kernel does NOT interact with the user directly.
User → Shell → Kernel → Hardware.
Shell acts as the middleman.

	2. Shell

The shell is a special program that provides an interface between the user and the kernel.

Main Work of Shell
Accept commands from the user (human-readable)
Convert them into machine instructions
Pass them to the kernel
Display output back to the user

Types of Shells
bash – Bourne Again Shell (most common)
sh – Original Bourne Shell
ksh – Korn Shell
zsh – Z Shell (advanced features)
fish – Friendly Interactive Shell (user-friendly)

	3. Shell Scripting
A shell script is a text file containing multiple shell commands that run sequentially just like a program.

What Shell Scripts Can Do
File operations
Program execution
User interaction
Automation of repetitive tasks
System administration tasks
Backup, monitoring, scheduling etc.
Basically, anything you can type in the terminal → you can put in a script.


	4. Important Requirements for Shell Scripts
4.1 Script File Creation
Use any editor like nano, vim, or touch.
Example:    $ nano script.sh

4.2 Add Shebang (recommended)
At the top of file:
#!/bin/bash	#This tells the OS to use bash to run the script.

4.3 Give Execute Permission
chmod +x script.sh

4.4 Run the Script
./script.sh


	5. Useful Commands During Editing
If using vim:
i → start editing
Esc → exit insert mode
:wq → save & quit
:q! → quit without saving


	6. Script Folder Example
You can create a separate folder for your scripts:
mkdir /root/script
cd /root/script
pwd
Example Output : /root/script

	7. Flow of Command Execution
User → Shell → Kernel → Hardware
Shell scripting automates this flow by putting multiple commands inside one file.
